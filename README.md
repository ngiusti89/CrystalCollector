# Crystal Collector Game

## Goal

The computer will generate a random number. The goal is for the user to reach this number.

Each crystal is worth a certain amount. When the user clicks on a crystal, its amount is added to the users total. If the user gets to the correct number, they win and the game resets, adding a win to their win tally. If they go over the number, they lose and the game resets, adding a loss to their losses tally.

### Gameplay notes
